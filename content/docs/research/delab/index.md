## About Data Engineering Lab

Delab conducted research in the areas of databases, data mining and sensor networks in the Department of Informatics at Aristotle University. Their research has been focused, but not limited to, on web mining, spatial and temporal databases, music databases, information retrieval, wireless sensor networks(indexing, caching, broadcasting, routing scheduling) and streaming data. Delab was later merged into Aristotle University Datalab.

## My Role at Data Engineering Lab

The research was part of my post-grad thesis on Location-based Social Networks at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, department of informatics, where I mainly compared existing recommendation frameworks with the one created by Data Engineering Lab
