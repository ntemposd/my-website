## About Kiwe

Infant Programming team of the late 2011. Kiwe's goal was to provide people with highly useful applications matching their needs. Using fresh academic knowledge, combined with high quality market research, Kiwe Development team was trying to fill market gaps based on real costumer needs and requirements.

## My role at Kiwe

Being the only business student in a group of tech students with zero work experience is quite fun. Kiwe was a first touchpoint with tech teams and the first step into the transition from university into the real tech market.

* Business plan preparation
* Product & business requirements gathering
* Customer lead generation
* Social media marketing

## Life at Kiwe

Early garage years with lots of ideas, beers and dirty implementations. If parsing the Olympic Games website to render the Olympics schedule into an Android app is now a joke, back in the days was feasible for the short-term.
