## About Lime

Located in more than 100 cities worldwide, Lime provides a modern mode of transportation for our changed world. Lime is founded on a simple idea that all communities deserve access to smart, affordable mobility. Through the equitable distribution of shared scooters, bikes and transit vehicles, Lime aims to reduce dependence on personal automobiles for short distance transportation and leave future generations with a cleaner, healthier planet.
