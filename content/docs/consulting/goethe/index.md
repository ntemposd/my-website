## About

The Cultural Entrepreneurship Hubs of the Goethe-Institut are centers for creative industry activity in which the start-up consultants trained by the Goethe-Institut and the Strascheg Center for Entrepreneurship will advise teams from the cultural and creative industries scene and work with them on their respective start-up ideas.

The Cultural Entrepreneurship Hubs provide a working environment offering not only consulting services, but also workshops, networking meetings and events for the respective creative industries scene. Creative ideas can be promoted, supported and enriched by the intercultural environment in this place. Entrepreneurial thinking in the creative industries here has a place for protected development. A community will emerge that will enable them to convert their creative and innovative businesses into scalable business models.

Through the close networking of the individual Goethe-Institut and links to the creative industries scene in Germany, an entrepreneurial network for cultural businesses will be created that is unique in this form worldwide.
