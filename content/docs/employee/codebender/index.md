## About

Codebender is the easiest, most advanced Arduino IDE for hobbyists, educators, and professionals. Write code easily in a great code editor, find bugs faster with the improved error output, and get inspiration by searching in the 350,000+ Arduino sketches on the platform.


## My Role

Throughout my time at wappier I have been managing products in the data visualization and adtech verticals. My main responsibilities were

* Advocating the product vision throughout the development cycles
* Crafting product roadmaps
* Writing down clear business requirements
* Leading documentation projects
* Exporting product data reports

## Life at codebender

Although the position has been remote, I've been visiting the Athens HQ's once a month to meet my colleagues, mix and mingle with them.
