## About SXSW

Founded in 1987 in Austin, Texas, SXSW is best known for its conference and festivals that celebrate the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries. The event, an essential destination for global professionals, features sessions, showcases, screenings, exhibitions, and a variety of networking opportunities. SXSW proves that the most unexpected discoveries happen when diverse topics and people come together.

## My role at SXSW

 I was honored to be the face and voice of SXSW Accelerator Pitch 2017 in Greece & Cyprus, as part of an 100+ people advisory board team comprised of experienced tech professionals from around the globe. SXSW Pitch is a featured startup showcase event that has an “open call” for startups to apply. From 2009 to 2021, 572 companies have participated in SXSW Pitch, with over 82% receiving funding and acquisitions in excess of $14.5 billion.

* Reviewed 80 startup applications for the fintech & big-data tracks
* Startups recruiting in Greece & Cyprus
* Public SXSW presentations to the local community

## Life at SXSW

Visiting the actual event, as an advisory board member, was eventually left in my backlog and remains there for the future.
