## About

Codebender is the easiest, most advanced Arduino IDE for hobbyists, educators, and professionals. Write code easily in a great code editor, find bugs faster with the improved error output, and get inspiration by searching in the 350,000+ Arduino sketches on the platform.


## My Role at codebender

Throughout my time at codebender we've tried to launch a spin-off product for K12 children,  targeting mainly STEM teachers. Playboard was a K12 educational product comprised of

* Advocating the product vision throughout the development cycles
* Crafting product roadmaps
* Writing down clear business requirements
* Leading documentation projects
* Exporting product data reports

## Life at codebender

Probably the coolest place I have worked. Back in the days cobender's HQs were hosted at P-Space, the Patra's hackerspace for makers and the place where the idea of codebender was born.
