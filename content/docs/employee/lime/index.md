## About Lime

Located in more than 100 cities worldwide, Lime provides a modern mode of transportation for our changed world. Lime is founded on a simple idea that all communities deserve access to smart, affordable mobility.
Through the equitable distribution of shared scooters, bikes and transit vehicles, Lime aims to reduce dependence on personal automobiles for short distance transportation and leave future generations with a cleaner, healthier planet.

## My Role

When Lime launched in Thessaloniki, Greece back in 2019; an opportunity to see how a tech unicorn could operate from the inside was laying right next to me. I really felt super curious - and even if I was going to mainly drive a Van and work night shifts, worth it.   

* Hunting scooters around the city using the company's van
* Scooters quality assurance
* Plugging and unplugging tons of scooters to/from the electricity
* Deploying scooters at the deployment points
* On-the-Spot supporting scooter riders with the app
