Sociallgreen was a tech startup, founded in 2012, that developed a concept new recycling approach for smart cities. Sociallgreen's approach integrates game logic and social network theories to enable a unique physical recycling game.

## My role at Sociallgreen

Role? Is startup founder a role? I have never seen anyone hiring a Startup Founder :). Being the only business person in a group of tech founders with no prior work experience is quite fun, while trying to hire when you never got hired is even funnier. At Sociallgreen I was doing what a tech startup needs to grow.

* Product management
* Business operations & financial management
* Fundraising
* Marketing management & communications
* UI/UX & human-machine interaction design

## Life at Sociallgreen

Jumping out of the university while a co-founder in a running hardware tech startup, a nationally awarded product that tried to disrupt recycling wasn't what I had in mind when planning my studies; however, it felt like the best experience I could ever had. From 3 to 10 people and from Thessaloniki to Athens and back home, the failure was messy but the whole ordeal was a power boost for what was coming ahead.
