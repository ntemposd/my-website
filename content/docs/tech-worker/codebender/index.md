## About

Codebender is the easiest, most advanced Arduino IDE for hobbyists, educators, and professionals. Write code easily in a great code editor, find bugs faster with the improved error output, and get inspiration by searching in the 350,000+ Arduino sketches on the platform.

## My Role at codebender

Throughout my time at codebender we've tried to launch a spin-off product for K12 children, targeting mainly STEM teachers. Playboard was a K12 educational product comprised of

* Product design
* Crowdfunding financial analysis and campaign preparation
* Customer & user research (Educator interviews, Kids workshops)
* Key account management

## Life at codebender

Probably the coolest place I have worked in. Back in the days codebender's HQs were hosted at P-Space, the Patra's hackerspace for makers and the place where the idea of codebender was born. I had moved in Patras, Grecee to join them and work from the comfort of their sofa. There everyday a team of 9 was eating lunch together and almost every evening drinking beers at the office. On Saturdays, we were playing around with electronics goodies.
