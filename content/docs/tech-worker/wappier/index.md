## My Role at wappier

Facilitating the production of contemporary entertainment tech solutions for on-chain and off-chain apps.

* Crafting product roadmaps
* Preparing and tracking features & business requirements
* Leading documentation projects

## Life at wappier

This is a 98% remote role now. Traveling to meet the team and attend events has been really cool pre-Pandemic, hope to do that when back to reality. The coolest story to tell though has been contributing to a growing organization that transitioned from Office to Remote in a week or so.
