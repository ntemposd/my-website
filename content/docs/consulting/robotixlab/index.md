## About Robotixlab

Robotixlab turns education into an unforgettable experience by creating concepts based on learning by doing, theme based scenarios, embracing failure and promoting iterative design cycles. Robotics engineers, creative educationalists and artists work together to bring to life tailor-made activities and custom made hardware. From robotics workshops to DIY electronics and more, Robotixlab people go bananas for tinkering.
