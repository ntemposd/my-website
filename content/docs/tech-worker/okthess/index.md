## About OK!Thess

Thessaloniki's very first municipal incubator for tech startups backed by 9 local organizations including universities, associations and governmental bodies. OK!Thess is a catalyst for the growth of Thessaloniki's innovation ecosystem.
It helps entrepreneurs bring innovative ideas to market through an acceleration program that includes training, coaching, matchmaking with mentors and access to capital. OK!Thess is also the place where community meetups and open events allow like-minded peers to mix and connect.

## My Role at OK!Thess

I have been the first contractor that eventually turned into an employee. Main goal was to prepare the ground for a prolific startup ecosystem establishment. I have been managing major parts of the project from scratch to 45 graduated startups & 200+ events/meetups.
