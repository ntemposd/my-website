## About Robotixlab

Robotixlab is all about merging innovation, creativity, design and technology with education. We are passionate turning education into an unforgettable experience, creating concepts based on experimentation and learning by doing, using theme based scenarios, embracing failure and promoting iterative design cycles. Robotics engineers, creative educationalists and artists work together to bring to life tailor-made activities and custom made hardware. From robotics workshops to DIY electronics, from 3D design, printing and making to interactive robotic exhibits for museums and from special robots for photographers to educational robot kits for kids, robotixlab people go bananas for tinkering.

## My Role at Robotixlab

I met Antony, the Founder of Robotixlab, during my days at codebender. Some months later we re-evaluated together Robotixlab's financials statements of the latest years, their current business model, created some new processes for the day to day financial operations, and brainstormed on potential revenue streams with crowdfunding in the middle.
